Documentation
-------------

Comprehensive documentation for Config4Cpp is available. However, it is
distributed separately from the source code. You can find the
documentation (in PDF and HTML formats) on www.config4star.org.


Compilation instructions
------------------------

The build system has been tested on: 
  (1) Linux with G++ 
  (2) Cygwin with G++
  (3) MinGW with G++

To build on Linux or Cygwin or MinGW, run the following commands:

	make

If you are building on another operating system, or with another
compiler, the you might need to edit "Makefile.inc" (if you are on a
UNIX-like operating system). 
You might also need to edit "src/platform.h" and "src/platform.cpp".

Executables will be put into the "bin" directory, and library files will
be put into the "lib" directory.
